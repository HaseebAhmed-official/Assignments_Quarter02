# *API*
An API (**Application Programming Interface**) is a set of rules and tools that allow software applications **to communicate and interact** with each other.
# ***SDK***
An SDK **(Software Development Kit)** is a **collection** of **tools**, **libraries**, and **documentation** to help developers **build software** for specific platforms or environments.
***For example:*** Like we install **python SDK** *google-generativeai* to interect with LLM

### Install the Python SDK for Google Generative AI
```bash
pip install -U -q google-generativeai
```

## ***WEB API's***
 Web APIs are APIs *specifically designed to be used over the web*, **enabling interaction between applications** through HTTP requests and responses.
 
 **For example**:When we login through google in facebook in this process facebook api requests google api for user data and google api then response to web api of facebook with userdata.so it is interaction between two different softwares or applications over internet.
# ***LIBRARY API's***
Library APIs are interfaces provided by **software libraries**, allowing developers to **use predefined functions or classes** to perform tasks *without* implementing them from scratch.

***According to my knowledge*** ::: i think it is an intercation between the parts or tools of the same software or application the parts or tools which are interecting they are basically a code and when we are interacting we in reality using different functions or classes in my opinion it is interaction within same software or application and web api is interaction between different softwares or applications over internet.
# ***PROMPTING AND COMPLETION***
**In AI**, prompting **refers** to the **input provided** to guide an LLM (Large Language Model)and completion is the **modelâ€™s generated response** based on the prompt.
 
 **USER**:*Prompting*= What is the capial of Pakistan?
 
 **LLM**:*Completion*= The capital of pakistan is **Islamabad**, it is full of greenery and having beautiful lanscapes.
